Title: QueueLinkedList - Linear Single Linked List Implementation of Queue in C++

Description:
QueueLinkedList is a C++ implementation of a queue data structure using a linear single linked list. This repository provides a flexible and efficient queue implementation, showcasing the use of a linked list as the underlying data structure for seamless queue operations.

Key Features:
- Linked List-Based Queue: QueueLinkedList utilizes a linear single linked list to store and manage queue elements, enabling efficient enqueueing and dequeueing operations.

- Enqueue and Dequeue Operations: The implementation includes essential queue operations, such as enqueue (to add elements to the back of the queue) and dequeue (to remove elements from the front of the queue).

- Dynamic Size: Unlike fixed-size arrays, QueueLinkedList supports dynamic resizing, allowing the queue to grow or shrink as elements are added or removed. This provides flexibility in handling varying queue sizes and efficient memory utilization.

- Efficient Memory Management: QueueLinkedList optimizes memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for nodes as elements are enqueued and deallocating memory as elements are dequeued, ensuring efficient memory utilization.

- Error Handling: The implementation incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle potential errors, such as queue underflow (when trying to dequeue from an empty queue) or memory allocation failures.

- Customizability and Extendability: QueueLinkedList serves as a foundation for further customization and extension. You can easily modify the implementation or build upon it to incorporate additional functionalities specific to your project requirements.

This QueueLinkedList repository is a valuable resource for understanding the queue data structure and exploring the implementation of queues using a linked list. Whether you're a student learning data structures or a developer looking to incorporate a dynamic queue into your projects, QueueLinkedList offers a reliable and efficient solution.

Explore the implementation, leverage the power of a linear single linked list as the underlying structure for queues, and enhance your understanding of queue operations in C++.
